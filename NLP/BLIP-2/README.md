# BLIP-2 notebooks

This folder contains notebooks to illustate Salesforce's BLIP-2 model in ðŸ¤— Transformers.

This folder contains notebooks for inference, but if you're interested in fine-tuning the model on custom data I recommend the following notebooks:

- https://github.com/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/examples/image_captioning_blip.ipynb (full fine-tuning)
- https://github.com/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/peft/Fine_tune_BLIP2_on_an_image_captioning_dataset_PEFT.ipynb (parameter efficient fine-tuning or PEFT)
(Or you can see this code in Example folder :3)

One can either update all the parameters of the model (full fine-tuning), or leverage newer methods like LoRa (available in the ðŸ¤— PEFT library) to freeze the weights of the pre-trained model and only train a couple of linear layers.
